 Spotify Recommendation System using Pyspark and Kafka streaming

* In this article, we delve into creating a content-based music recommendation system using various tools and techniques. Leveraging technologies like Kafka for data streaming, PySpark for data manipulation and analysis, Spark SQL for query operations, and Streamlit for visualization, we aim to recommend songs similar to those in our liked playlist from a streaming data source.

1. Data Streaming with Kafka: We use Kafka to stream data from a source, ensuring a continuous flow of information for real-time analysis.

2. PySpark Dataframe and Spark SQL: PySpark's powerful dataframe capabilities coupled with Spark SQL enable us to manipulate and query large datasets efficiently.

3. MLlib for Analysis: Utilizing MLlib, we perform KMeans clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze the music data and identify patterns.

3. Content-Based Recommendation: By understanding the features of songs in our liked playlist, we employ content-based filtering to recommend similar songs from the streaming data source.

4. Visualization with Streamlit: Streamlit is employed for creating an intuitive and interactive interface to visualize the recommendation results and provide a seamless user experience.
